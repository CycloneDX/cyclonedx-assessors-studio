# Assessors Studio

> ⚠️ **Status: Active Development**\
> Assessors Studio is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.

Assessors Studio is a purpose-built platform for operationalizing [CycloneDX Attestations (CDXA)](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/attestations/). It enables organizations to perform structured assessments, gather verifiable evidence, assert claims, and issue machine-readable attestations using **CycloneDX**, an internationally recognized standard for software and system transparency.

Built for modern assurance workflows, Assessors Studio transforms compliance from static documentation into structured, automatable, and exchangeable artifacts.

## Why CycloneDX Attestations?

CycloneDX Attestations extend traditional SBOMs into formalized claims and verifiable statements. Instead of PDFs, spreadsheets, or point-in-time audit reports, attestations are:

- Machine-readable
- Traceable to supporting evidence
- Designed for automated validation
- Exchangeable across organizational boundaries

CDXA supports both **electronic signatures** and **digital signatures**, enabling attestations to serve operational, contractual, and legally binding purposes when required.

The model structures assurance around:

- **Requirements** -- what must be satisfied
- **Claims** -- assertions of conformance
- **Evidence** -- artifacts supporting those claims
- **Attestations** -- signed statements asserting truthfulness

## Core Capabilities

### Structured Assessments

Conduct repeatable assessments aligned to defined requirements, with workflow support for contributors, reviewers, and approvers.

### Evidence Management

Attach documentation, scan results, test artifacts, third-party reports, and other supporting materials directly to claims while preserving provenance and traceability.

### Claim Authoring

Express conformance statements in a standardized format that downstream systems can parse, validate, and automate against.

### Machine-Readable Attestations

Generate CycloneDX attestations that can be consumed by governance, risk, compliance, procurement, and security automation platforms.

### Electronic & Digital Signatures

Support for both electronic and cryptographic digital signatures enables flexible deployment models --- from internal approvals to externally verifiable, legally binding B2B or B2G attestations.

## Works with the Existing CycloneDX Standards Library

Assessors Studio integrates directly with the growing ecosystem of standards already available in CycloneDX format. This includes machine-readable representations of regulatory frameworks, industry standards, and internal policy requirements.

Rather than manually recreating control catalogs, teams can:

- Import existing CycloneDX-formatted standards
- Map internal controls to recognized frameworks
- Reuse requirement definitions across assessments
- Generate attestations aligned to multiple standards simultaneously

This promotes consistency, reduces duplication, and enables cross-framework traceability.

---

## Designed for Automation & Interoperability

Because attestations are structured data artifacts, not static documents, they can be:

- Validated automatically
- Electronically or digitally signed
- Verified independently
- Integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- Exchanged via transparency and assurance ecosystems such as the [Transparency Exchange API](https://tc54.org/tea/)

Assessors Studio enables a shift from narrative compliance to computational, machine-verifiable trust.

---

## Who It's For

- Product Security teams
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) leaders
- Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs)
- Procurement and vendor risk teams
- Independent assessors and auditors

---

## The Outcome

Assessors Studio operationalizes CycloneDX Attestations, enabling organizations to move from manual reporting to verifiable, machine-readable assurance; suitable for automation, audit, and contractual trust.
